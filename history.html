              The ways of God are unsearchable…they are above finding out! The
              love of God surpasses our understanding and He knows the thoughts
              He has for each of His children; thoughts of peace and not of
              evil, to bring us to an expected end. Born through adversity, God
              birthed Endure To The End Ministries in 2000 while Pastor and
              Co-Pastor Rountree resided at 1860 I Street, Unit B, Grand Forks
              Air Force Base, North Dakota. God had impressed deep in Pastor
              Rountree’s heart that His word is true, that we the saints of God
              must endure hardness as a good soldier, that the race is not
              always unto the swift nor the battle to the strong, but he must
              endure to the end and let no one steal his crown! Thus, with
              renewed vigor to run this race with patience and endurance, Endure
              To The End Ministries was born!

            Pastor and Mother Rountree served in North Dakota under the
            leadership of Bishop Michael R. Cole from June 1994 until the Lord
            called them to relocate to the United Kingdom in May 2003. After a
            two-year tour of duty, they served in Albuquerque, New Mexico at
            Grace Covenant Church of God In Christ under the watchful eye of
            Pastor James Johnson. In May 2008, the Lord sent them here to
            Bellevue, Nebraska, where they served as lay ministers in the
            Capehart Chapel before settling at Christ Cathedral Church of God in
            Christ, laboring in the vineyard with Pastor Kevin Johnson. However,
            throughout all of their travels, Pastor and Mother Rountree watched
            over Endure To The End Ministries, knowing God would call them to go
            forth at His appointed time.

            <br /><br />In October 2011, the Lord spoke to Pastor Rountree and
            told him it was time to enter into the vineyard that had been given
            unto him. After much prayer and fasting and staying before the Lord,
            Pastor and Co-pastor Rountree held their first Bible Study as
            Pastors of Endure To The End Ministries on Wednesday, February 29,
            2012. For those that don’t remember, that was Leap Day of the Leap
            Year, and yes, stepping out was a leap of Faith! The Spirit of the
            Lord moved mightily in both the Bible study and Sunday services,
            healing the Saints of their wounds and renewing a right spirit
            within them. The freedom enjoyed in the liberty of the Spirit caused
            the Saints to seek the Lord with all their hearts and they reaped
            the blessing of a strong personal relationship with the Lord. God’s
            hand upon the ministry was evident.

            <br /><br />
            You see, Endure To The End Ministries is an oasis in the desert, a
            safe haven if you will, and some come for a season of refreshing
            before moving on and others find their place of ministry and a home
            here in the Lord. This has been a place of healing and deliverance,
            and the Lord has been in the midst of all things. The Saints have
            testified of answered prayers, academic success in the classroom as
            the Lord has brought all things back to their remembrance, even how
            God has opened doors that were previously closed and how He closed
            doors that were previously open! Oh, what a great God we serve!

            <br /><br />The families of Endure To The End Ministries are
            faithful to the call of God upon their lives. We will run this race
            with patience and endurance, looking unto Jesus, the author and
            finisher of our faith, for “he who endures to the end, the same
            shall be saved.”

            <br /><br />Endure To The End Ministries COGIC celebrated our First
            Church Anniversary on Friday night, 1 March 2013, at 1900. The
            church was in a 40-day fast leading up to the celebration and Pastor
            and Co-Pastor had just completed a 46-day fast seeking God’s
            presence and blessing on the Saints of God and on the celebration.
            Bishop Michael R. Cole, the Prelate for the North Dakota
            Jurisdiction COGIC and my spiritual father in the Gospel, was our
            guest speaker. He traveled with Evangelist Sohan from New Jersey via
            Trinidad, and a young African, Brother Ahtu, from Cameroon now
            living in Grand Forks. What a great celebration. We took the piano
            downstairs to the church so Bishop could be free to minister as the
            Spirit directed him. There was much warfare leading up to the
            service but that’s to be expected when God is going to pour out His
            spirit upon His people. The Saints looked beautiful and Mother
            Rountree and I were so proud of them.<br /><br />

            The Word of The Lord out of Zechariah 4:10 declares, “For who hath
            despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall
            see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are
            the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth!”
            Yes, the eyes of the Lord watched over Endure To The End Ministries
            and with great joy the Saints of God celebrated their first church
            anniversary on March 1, 2013 at their home church. The second year
            saw change and growth come to the ministry. The Lord continued to
            use the ministry as an oasis in the desert, a resting place for the
            weary, and a place of healing for the wounded and broken. The Lord
            God pressed upon us that we are truly members of one body, fitly
            joined together, with each of us having a purpose in edifying the
            body. Pastor and Co-Pastor Rountree realized though, that no man
            goes to war without first counting the costs, and that everything
            they sought to build for the Lord would encounter opposition.
            However, the Lord God is faithful to those who seek His face. Not
            only did the ministry grow physically but God blessed us
            tremendously by His Spirit! He utilized every gift in the
            body—teaching, preaching, prayer, worship, healing, prophesying—to
            bring us to a new level in Him! Every testimony praises Him for what
            He has done in our lives. Yes, we have had challenges. Yes, there
            have been dry places, but the Lord has been our strong tower and our
            oasis in the desert place. Bless His holy name!<br /><br />

            Pastor and Co-Pastor Rountree continue to nourish and foster the
            vision the Lord has given them for this ministry. God has given them
            strong Warriors to labor with them in the vineyard. Today, the
            church stands at the bank of the Jordan, poised to cross over into
            the promised land. Yes, for these first two years we have worshiped
            in our house church—and the Lord has blessed us mightily!! But the
            time has come for us to expand our territory and move out into a
            building at 1502 J. F. Kennedy Drive, Bellevue that we will call
            home. We will have greater opportunities for outreach…greater
            opportunities to share the Gospel message and greater opportunities
            to impact our community. Yes, we do give God the Glory for all He
            has done! We do not despise the day of small things, and as we enter
            into our third year of being,<span>
              this is our declared time of abundance…we are living in the
              overflow!</span
